# Hide-divi-projects
Functions.php Snippet

Add this to your child-theme or custom theme functions.php file to hide/disable the 'Projects' Custom Post Type.
When using the Divi Page Builder plugin.

***If using the Divi Theme, be sure to use a child-theme***
For information on creating a child-theme, see this article:

Ideal for when you are building a site that will not require the Projects CPT.
